# ReflectionRemoval

This contains required codes for implementing reflection removal in images through non-convex normalization of gradients

Files:

1) Outputs: Contains Results of algorithm along with the original images
2) reflection_removal.m - MATLAB function to implement reflection removal

3) main_reflection_removal.m - MATLAB script which calls the function reflection_removal.m

4) main_reflection_removal_generator.m - Same as the previous one, but generates results ona different set of images. Use of either one should serve the purpose

5) result_images = Folder having input,transmission and reflection layers of various inputs
